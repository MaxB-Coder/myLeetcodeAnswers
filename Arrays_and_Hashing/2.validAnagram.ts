/* Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Example 1:

Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"
Output: false

Constraints:

s and t consist of lowercase English letters. */

export const validAnagram = (s: string, t: string): boolean => {
  // Check if the strings are the same length, if not then return false
  // Use a map
  // Count the frequency of each letter
  // Or
  // Use an array with 26 0s
  // Value of each letter with char codes, first word adds to correct character, second word takes away.
  // If the final array is 26 0s then they are anagrams
  return Boolean();
};
